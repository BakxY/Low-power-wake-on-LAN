# Low power wake on LAN

The goal for this project is to create a device the doesn't need much power in the target network. This will be achieved with a very small hardware that can be plugged into any standard usb a plug on a pc or by attaching a external 12V power supply to the device. The hardware will also need to be connected to the lan using a standard RJ45 cable. 
The hardware will periodicity request data from the API that is also a part of this project and will send a WOL packet to the device that should be woken up. To manage the devices a website will e created using nextjs. This website and API will have to be online all the time so the system can work properly. 

More infos are to come in the future
